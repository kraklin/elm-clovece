# elm-clovece

Elm implementation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_ärgere_dich_nicht (Člověče, nezlob se in Czech)

## Why this game?

It was my first game, that I programmed back in my early days of Visual Basic and lost it when I couldn't read it back from 3.5" diskette. Oh, youth :) 
So this is great project to learn elm, which I'm starting to like more and more :D
